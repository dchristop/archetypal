\title{Application of FurthestSum Algorithm in Order to Find an Intial Solution for Archetypal Analyis}
\usage{
FurthestSum(Y, kappas, irows, exclude = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{The data frame with dimensions \eqn{n \times d}}

\item{kappas}{The number of archetypes}

\item{irows}{The initially used rows of data frame for starting algorithm}

\item{exclude}{The rows of data frame that we want to exclude from being checked}
}
\value{
The vector of rows that constitute the initial FurthestSum solution
}
\description{
The FurthestSum algorithm as was written by Morup and Hansen
in Matlab, see [1] and it is based on [2]. The algorithm has been converted in order to use commonly used 
data frames in R.
